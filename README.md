The second section digs into CSS which is essentially used to style and layout a webpage. Section three can be used to help understand how Git works and what commands are necessary in order to design new branches while you are building a webpage. Section four revolves around JavaScript and how it can be incorporated into a program in order to create interactive web content. By opening up DevTools console, you are able to see that JavaScript is running.
